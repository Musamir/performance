# Performance

Hi, my name is Musamir, and I am sharing here examples that interest me, and I hope you find them interesting. In this repository I am exploring the performance of different approaches to solving the same tasks. If you
find any bugs, I would appreciate it if you let me know. Also, if you have any questions, I would love to answer them.
